# QuotaProvider plugin protocol

`QuotaProvider` is an optional schema-v1 plugin capability. It lets a provider plugin fetch
provider-specific quota and plan data while the host owns lifecycle, normalization, persistence,
and management delivery.

## Capability and methods

Plugins advertise `quota_provider: true` in `plugin.register` and implement:

- `quota.identifier` -> `{ "identifier": "gemini-cli" }`
- `quota.fetch` -> `pluginapi.QuotaFetchResponse`

Adding these method names is backward compatible with ABI/schema v1. Hosts ignore the capability
when it is absent, and older plugins continue to register normally.

The fetch request contains the concrete auth ID/provider, provider-owned storage JSON, metadata,
attributes, the previous normalized snapshot, host configuration, and a host HTTP callback. A
plugin must use the callback for upstream requests; it must not expose access tokens or endpoint
credentials in the returned snapshot.

## Normalized snapshot v1

The host persists `QuotaSnapshot` rather than provider response bodies. Its stable fields are:

- `schema_version`, `provider`, and `observed_at_ms`
- `items[]`: stable `id`, display `label`, kind, remaining fraction/amount, limit/unit, reset time,
  represented model IDs, and non-secret metadata
- optional `plan`: provider tier ID/label, normalized kind, credit balance, and observation state
- non-fatal `warnings[]` and non-secret snapshot metadata

Fractions are normalized to `0..1` and used percentages to `0..100`. A plugin returning a schema
newer than the host supports is rejected instead of being silently persisted.

## Partial success and last-known-good plan

Quota and plan probes may have different availability. When the primary quota probe succeeds but
the plan probe fails, the plugin returns the new items with `plan_unavailable: true` and a
non-secret `plan_error`. The host retains the previous plan, marks it stale, records the error, and
persists the combined snapshot. A transient plan failure therefore cannot erase a previously known
subscription.

## Gemini CLI Core compatibility adapter

The current Gemini CLI plugin does not need to implement or advertise this capability. When no
native `QuotaProvider` matches `gemini-cli`, Core recognizes the plugin's existing executor and uses
its `Executor.HttpRequest` for:

- `POST .../v1internal:retrieveUserQuota` as the primary observation
- `POST .../v1internal:loadCodeAssist` as the supplementary plan observation

This preserves the plugin's authentication injection, token refresh, proxy path, and request
fingerprint. Core only owns quota/plan parsing. Gemini model buckets are collapsed into stable Flash Lite, Flash, and Pro groups. Gemini 2.0 Flash
buckets are ignored. `paidTier` wins when it has an ID; otherwise `currentTier` is used. Tier IDs are
normalized as follows: `free-tier -> free`, `legacy-tier -> legacy`, `standard-tier -> standard`,
`g1-pro-tier -> pro`, and `g1-ultra-tier -> ultra`.

## Management and persistence

`POST /v0/management/quota/fetch` accepts `{ "auth_index": "..." }`. The host resolves the auth,
loads its previous snapshot from SQLite, invokes the matching plugin, applies any auth refresh,
persists the normalized snapshot, and returns it. The browser is a reader of this canonical record.

The management overlay uses the host endpoint on current Core releases. It falls back to the old
browser bridge only when connected to a Core version where that route does not exist. `/plugins`
reports `quota_mode: legacy-adapter` for the current Gemini plugin and `quota_mode: native` when a
future plugin implements `QuotaProvider`; native capability always wins.
